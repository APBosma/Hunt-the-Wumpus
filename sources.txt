I used a website to graph out my cave initially before creating it (https://graphonline.top/en/). I have the graph saved in a secret location so you can't cheat Mr. Bowe (Dr. Bowe when?). 

I used our previous work in networking to map out our cave once I had the graph so that it was easy to get possible rooms for the character and Wumpus to travel to.

Forgot if I had to use commas in dictionaries so I used https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp for reference.

Used Yahtzee for reference for testing and my class because I forgot it's __init__, not _innit_ like some British person.

Professor Bowe helped me with GitHub actions because I had to change GitHub actions to work for my code. He also revealed I could not take input for GitHub actions testing. Professor Bowe also helped me fix my docker by showing me that I had to do "docker run -it address" instead of "docker run -i address."

I did not use AI for this project.

Everything in this code works (Probably).
