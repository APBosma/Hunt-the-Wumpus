Hunt the Wumpus
===============

These project was created for my DevOps final and was inspired by the original Hunt the Wumpus. The instructions were pulled from iFiction's copy of [Hunt the Wumpus](https://www.ifiction.org/games/playz.php?cat=1&game=249&mode=html).

Every function in this project should have docstrings that explain the inputs, outputs, and what the function does. All instructions on how to play the game are available once you get it running by pressing 1 at the start.

Docker
-----------

To run this project, simply build the docker file and then run it. It will be baller.
