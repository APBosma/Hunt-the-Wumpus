Hunt the Wumpus
===============

These project was created for my DevOps final and was inspired by the original Hunt the Wumpus. The instructions were pulled from iFiction's copy of [Hunt the Wumpus](https://www.ifiction.org/games/playz.php?cat=1&game=249&mode=html). All other sources for my code are in sources.txt and available for anyone looking to see what I used besides my own head to create this project.

Every function in this project should have docstrings that explain the inputs, outputs, and what the function does. All instructions on how to play the game are available once you get it running by pressing 1 at the start.

Docker
-----------

To run this project, simply build the docker file and then run it with docker run -it _address_. It will be baller. Your mind will be blown
